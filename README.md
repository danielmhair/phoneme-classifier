## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory called `fast-api-phoneme-python`.
2. Inside the `fast-api-phoneme-python` directory, create a `src` directory.
3. Inside the `src` directory, create an empty file called `__init__.py`.
4. Inside the `src` directory, create a file called `main.py` and add your main Python code.
5. Inside the `fast-api-phoneme-python` directory, create a `tests` directory.
6. Inside the `tests` directory, create an empty file called `__init__.py`.
7. Inside the `tests` directory, create a file called `test_main.py` and add your unit tests using the `pytest` framework.
8. Create a file called `requirements.txt` and list the dependencies for your project.
9. Create a file called `.flake8` and configure the linter settings.
10. Create a file called `pytest.ini` and configure the `pytest` settings.
11. Create a file called `README.md` and add the documentation for your project.

## Usage

To run the project, you can use the following commands:

- Install the project dependencies:

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Run in 2 terminals
  - cd src2 && uvicorn app:app --reload
  - cd src && uvicorn phoneme_api:app --reload
  - python main.py [name] [character_sound] [amount_of_tries]

/sc:workflow Generate a PRD in a new tasks folder, but make sure to use the notion mcp to ensure you understand the theme, current epic and task we are on. Then create a good workflow from this. Notice the dist folder, and recordings folder to understand what type of output I'm expecting for the Live Phoneme CTCs and how they fit in. In the end, we want a good design where its very modular, not huge files. Do not deal with backwards compatability AND be simple and use good practices for design. Do not overengineer.
