# Next Steps Guide - Phoneme Classifier Project

**Updated:** 2025-08-23  
**Current Status:** Epic 1 at 95% completion - WavLM CTC implementation required

## Epic 1 Completion: WavLM CTC Implementation

### Current Achievement: 95% Complete ✅

**Successfully Implemented:**
- ✅ Wav2Vec2 CTC workflow (`workflows/ctc_w2v2_workflow/`)
- ✅ MLP baseline workflow (`workflows/mlp_control_workflow/`)
- ✅ Model comparison framework (`workflows/shared/model_comparison.py`)
- ✅ Ensemble methods (`workflows/shared/ensemble_methods.py`)
- ✅ Real-time inference capabilities
- ✅ ONNX deployment formats
- ✅ Performance benchmarking (0.44ms inference, 2,296 samples/sec)

### Critical Missing Component: 5% Remaining ❌

**Epic 1 Requirement:** Two CTC model implementations for comparison
1. ✅ Wav2Vec2 CTC - COMPLETE
2. ❌ **WavLM CTC - REQUIRED FOR EPIC 1 COMPLETION**

## Immediate Priority: WavLM CTC Workflow

### Step 1: Create WavLM CTC Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p workflows/wavlm_ctc_workflow/{models,validations,utils}
```

**Required Files:**
```
workflows/wavlm_ctc_workflow/
├── 0_workflow.py                      # Main 5-step pipeline
├── s0_cleanup_previous_wavlm_ctc.py   # Cleanup step
├── s1_prepare_audio_wavlm_ctc.py      # Audio preparation
├── s2_extract_wavlm_embeddings.py     # WavLM feature extraction  
├── s3_train_wavlm_ctc.py              # WavLM CTC training
├── s4_test_wavlm_ctc.py               # WavLM CTC inference
├── models/
│   └── wavlm_ctc_model.py             # WavLM CTC architecture
├── validations/
│   └── classify_voice_wavlm_ctc.py    # Testing script
└── utils/
    └── wavlm_processing.py            # WavLM-specific utilities
```

### Step 2: Implement WavLM Integration

**Key Changes from Wav2Vec2 Implementation:**
```python
# Replace in embedding extraction:
from transformers import Wav2Vec2Model
# with:
from transformers import WavLMModel

# Model initialization:
model = WavLMModel.from_pretrained("microsoft/wavlm-base")
# vs:
model = Wav2Vec2Model.from_pretrained("facebook/wav2vec2-base")
```

**Architecture Reuse:**
- ✅ LSTM sequence encoder (architecture-agnostic)
- ✅ CTC head and loss function (model-agnostic)  
- ✅ Training loop and validation logic
- ✅ Audio preprocessing pipeline

### Step 3: Update Poetry Configuration

Add to `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.poe.tasks.train-wavlm-ctc]
help = "Run WavLM CTC Workflow"
cmd = "python workflows/wavlm_ctc_workflow/0_workflow.py"

[tool.poe.tasks.test-wavlm-ctc]
help = "Test WavLM CTC model inference"  
cmd = "python workflows/wavlm_ctc_workflow/validations/classify_voice_wavlm_ctc.py"

[tool.poe.tasks.train-all-ctc]
help = "Run both CTC workflows (Wav2Vec2 + WavLM)"
sequence = ["train-ctc", "train-wavlm-ctc"]

[tool.poe.tasks.compare-all-models]
help = "Compare all three models (MLP + Wav2Vec2-CTC + WavLM-CTC)"
shell = "PYTHONPATH=$PWD python workflows/shared/model_comparison.py --include-wavlm"
```

### Step 4: Extend Model Comparison Framework

**Update `workflows/shared/model_comparison.py`:**
- Add WavLM CTC loading and benchmarking
- Extend performance comparison to three models
- Update ensemble methods for triple-model combinations

### Step 5: Validation and Testing

**Success Criteria:**
1. WavLM CTC training completes successfully
2. Inference time <1ms per sample (matching Wav2Vec2 CTC)
3. Model comparison report includes all three models
4. Ensemble methods work with WavLM CTC included

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Core WavLM Implementation (2-3 days)
- [ ] Create directory structure and base files
- [ ] Implement WavLM embedding extraction
- [ ] Adapt CTC model for WavLM inputs
- [ ] Create training pipeline

### Phase 2: Integration and Testing (1 day)  
- [ ] Update model comparison framework
- [ ] Test inference performance
- [ ] Validate ensemble methods
- [ ] Update documentation

### Phase 3: Epic 1 Completion Validation (0.5 day)
- [ ] Run complete pipeline: `poe train-all-ctc`
- [ ] Generate three-way model comparison
- [ ] Verify Epic 1 requirements fully met
- [ ] Update status documentation

## Dependencies

**No Additional Packages Required:**
- ✅ `transformers[torch]` - Already supports WavLM models
- ✅ `torch`, `torchaudio` - PyTorch framework in place  
- ✅ Audio processing libraries configured
- ✅ All training infrastructure ready

## Risk Mitigation

**Low Risk Items:**
- Model loading (same transformers API)
- Architecture components (reusable LSTM/CTC)
- Training methodology (established patterns)

**Moderate Risk Items:**
- WavLM embedding dimension compatibility (likely 768 like Wav2Vec2)
- Hyperparameter optimization for WavLM characteristics
- Performance parity with Wav2Vec2 CTC
