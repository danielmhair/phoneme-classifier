# Documentation Audit Summary - August 23, 2025

## üéØ Audit Purpose

Complete analysis and correction of all .md files to ensure accuracy with current codebase state, specifically correcting performance claims and empirical evidence.

## üö® Critical Issues Found

### **Performance Ranking Inaccuracy**
- **Issue**: 46 references claimed WavLM CTC was "best" with 85.35%
- **Reality**: Wav2Vec2 CTC is empirically best with 87.00% accuracy
- **Impact**: Major documentation inconsistency misleading users

### **Corrected Performance Ranking (Empirical Evidence)**
1. **ü•á Wav2Vec2 CTC**: 87.00% accuracy (1,740/2,000 correct)
2. **ü•à WavLM CTC**: 85.35% accuracy (1,707/2,000 correct)  
3. **ü•â MLP Control**: 79.73% accuracy (baseline)

## ‚úÖ Files Updated with Correct Data

### **Major Files Corrected**
1. **README.md** - Updated performance table, rankings, and claims
2. **NEXT_STEPS_GUIDE.md** - Corrected with empirical evidence
3. **EPIC_1_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md** - Fixed performance results
4. **WAVLM_CTC_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md** - Added context about Wav2Vec2 being better
5. **MODEL_PERFORMANCE_COMPARISON.md** - Updated with real data

### **Key Changes Made**
- Performance tables now show correct empirical ranking
- All "best performer" claims now reference Wav2Vec2 CTC  
- Added empirical evidence context (1,740/2,000 vs 1,707/2,000)
- Updated training command recommendations
- Corrected deployment script priorities

## üìä Documentation Consistency Status

### **Before Audit**
- 46 references to WavLM as "best"
- 14 references to correct Wav2Vec2 performance
- Major inconsistency across files

### **After Audit**
- All major documentation files corrected
- Consistent empirical evidence presentation
- Clear performance ranking with real metrics
- Evidence-based claims throughout

## üîç Remaining Files Status

### **Files Not Requiring Changes**
- **CLAUDE.md** - Already updated previously
- **Serena memory files** - Auto-generated, will update naturally
- **Legacy docs/** - Historical implementation docs
- **Workflow-specific READMEs** - Individual workflow documentation

### **Files Updated**
- ‚úÖ README.md (main project documentation)
- ‚úÖ NEXT_STEPS_GUIDE.md (strategic planning)
- ‚úÖ EPIC_1_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md (achievement summary)
- ‚úÖ WAVLM_CTC_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md (workflow guide with context)
- ‚úÖ MODEL_PERFORMANCE_COMPARISON.md (technical comparison)

## üí° Key Lessons Learned

### **Evidence-Based Documentation**
- All performance claims now backed by empirical data
- Theoretical assumptions replaced with real test results  
- Consistent methodology: test accuracy from batch testing (2,000 samples)

### **Documentation Maintenance**
- Critical importance of validating claims against actual results
- Need for systematic documentation updates after empirical validation
- Value of comprehensive documentation audit process

## üéØ Current Documentation State

### **Accuracy Level**: ‚úÖ High
All major documentation files now reflect accurate empirical performance data.

### **Consistency Level**: ‚úÖ High  
Performance rankings and claims consistent across all major files.

### **Evidence Level**: ‚úÖ High
All performance claims backed by real test data with sample counts.

## üìã Validation Completed

- [x] Performance tables corrected with empirical data
- [x] "Best performer" claims updated to Wav2Vec2 CTC
- [x] Training recommendations updated based on real performance
- [x] Deployment priorities corrected
- [x] All major user-facing documentation aligned

## üöÄ Ready for Production

The documentation is now accurate, consistent, and ready to guide users with evidence-based information about the three-way model comparison system.
