# CTC Implementation Summary

## üéØ Overview

The implementation provides a complete alternative to the existing MLP classifier that can handle variable-length sequences without requiring explicit alignment.

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### Core CTC Components

- **`workflows/mlp_control_workflow/models/ctc_model.py`** - Complete CTC architecture
  - `CTCModel` with Wav2Vec2 feature extraction, LSTM sequence encoding, and CTC head
    - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A type of recurrent neural network that processes sequences by maintaining memory of previous inputs, ideal for temporal data like speech
  - Supports both training and inference modes
  - Beam search and greedy decoding
    - Beam search maintains multiple candidate sequences (beams) and explores the top-k most promising paths.
      - Pros: Explores multiple paths, often finds better global solutions
      - Cons: Computationally expensive (k times slower), more memory usage.
    - Greedy decoding selects the most probable token at each step, making locally optimal choices.
      - Pros: Fast, simple, deterministic
      - Cons: Can get stuck in suboptimal sequences, no way to recover from early mistakes.
  - Factory function: `create_ctc_model(num_classes=37)`

- **`workflows/mlp_control_workflow/s2_extract_embeddings_temporal.py`** - Temporal embedding extraction
  - Preserves temporal sequences instead of mean pooling
  - Backward compatible with existing pipeline
  - Handles variable-length sequences with memory management

## üìä Architecture Comparison

| Feature | MLP Classifier | CTC Classifier |
|---------|----------------|----------------|

| Alignment | Requires explicit alignment | Alignment-free (CTC handles internally) |
| Training Data | Single phoneme per sample | Can handle phoneme sequences |
| Real-time Capability | ‚úÖ Fast inference | ‚úÖ Sequence-aware inference |
| Memory Usage | Low (768-dim vectors) | Higher (temporal sequences) |
| Complexity | Simple sklearn MLP | PyTorch LSTM + CTC |

## üîß Usage Instructions

```bash
# MLP (existing)
python validations/classify_voice_pkl.py

# CTC (new)
