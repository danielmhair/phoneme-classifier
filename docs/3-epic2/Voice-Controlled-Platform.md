## 4. Interfaces & Data Contracts

### Voice Recognition Interface

```typescript
interface PhonemeClassifierConfig {
  model1Url: string;
  model2Url: string;
  sampleRate: number;        // Default: 16000
  windowSize: number;        // Default: 512
  threshold: number;         // Default: 0.7
}

interface VoiceRecognitionResult {
  command: string;
  confidence: number;
  timestamp: number;
  source: 'onnx' | 'webspeech';
}

interface PhonemeClassifier {
  initialize(): Promise<void>;
  startListening(callback: (result: string) => void): Promise<void>;
  stopListening(): void;
  isInitialized(): boolean;
  dispose(): void;
}
```

### React-Phaser Communication

```typescript
interface GameEvents {
  'score-update': (score: number) => void;
  'word-update': (word: string) => void;
  'game-state-update': (state: GameState) => void;
  'voice-command': (command: string) => void;
}

interface GameState {
  status: 'playing' | 'paused' | 'gameover';
  score: number;
  level: number;
  lives: number;
}

interface PhaserGameProps {
  onScoreUpdate: (score: number) => void;
  onWordUpdate: (word: string) => void;
  onGameStateUpdate: (state: GameState) => void;
  phonemeClassifier?: PhonemeClassifier | null;
}
```

### Game Scene Interface

```typescript
interface GameScene {
  player: Phaser.Physics.Matter.Image;
  platforms: Phaser.Physics.Matter.Image[];
  collectibles: Phaser.Physics.Matter.Image[];
  score: number;
  targetWords: string[];
  performAction(command: string): void;
  handleCollision(event: CollisionEvent): void;
}

interface VoiceCommand {
  name: string;
  action: (player: Phaser.Physics.Matter.Image) => void;
  cooldown: number;
  description: string;
}
```

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC-001**: Given ONNX models are properly configured, When user speaks "JUMP" command, Then player character jumps within 500ms
- **AC-002**: Given voice recognition fails, When fallback Web Speech API is available, Then system automatically switches without user intervention
- **AC-003**: Given game is running at 60fps, When voice processing is active, Then frame rate shall not drop below 55fps
- **AC-004**: Given user uploads invalid ONNX model, When initialization fails, Then system shall display clear error message and fallback gracefully
- **AC-005**: Given player collects gem, When collision occurs, Then score increases by 50 points and UI updates immediately
- **AC-006**: Given microphone permission is denied, When game starts, Then system shall provide clear instructions and keyboard fallback
- **AC-007**: Given voice command has 1-second cooldown, When user speaks rapidly, Then only first command executes and subsequent commands are ignored
- **AC-008**: Given React game state changes, When score updates, Then Phaser scene receives notification via game events

## 7. Rationale & Context

### Voice Recognition Strategy

The dual-mode approach (ONNX + Web Speech API) provides optimal user experience by leveraging cutting-edge ML models when available while maintaining broad browser compatibility through Web Speech API fallback. This architecture ensures the application remains functional across diverse hardware and browser environments.

### React-Phaser Integration

Event-driven communication pattern minimizes coupling between React UI state and Phaser game logic while enabling real-time synchronization. This approach allows independent development and testing of UI components and game mechanics.

### TypeScript Implementation

Strict typing ensures code reliability and enhances AI agent comprehension for automated development tasks. Type definitions serve as living documentation and enable better tooling support.

### Matter.js Physics Integration

Realistic physics simulation enhances gameplay immersion while providing predictable character movement for voice command responsiveness. The physics engine handles collision detection and provides stable foundation for platform game mechanics.

## 9. Examples & Edge Cases

### Voice Command Processing Example

```typescript
// Successful voice command execution flow
class VoiceCommandProcessor {
  async processCommand(audioData: Float32Array): Promise<VoiceResult> {
    try {
      // Primary: ONNX model inference
      const onnxResult = await this.classifyWithONNX(audioData);
      if (onnxResult.confidence > 0.7) {
        return { command: onnxResult.label, source: 'onnx' };
      }
      
      // Fallback: Web Speech API
      const webSpeechResult = await this.processWithWebSpeech(audioData);
      return { command: webSpeechResult, source: 'webspeech' };
      
    } catch (error) {
      // Graceful degradation to keyboard input
      console.warn('Voice processing failed:', error);
      return { command: null, source: 'none' };
    }
  }
}
```

### React-Phaser Event Communication

```typescript
// React component receiving game updates
const GameContainer: React.FC = () => {
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const game = phaserGameRef.current;
    
    // Subscribe to game events
    game.events.on('score-update', (newScore: number) => {
      setScore(newScore);
    });
    
    return () => game.events.removeAllListeners();
  }, []);
  
  // Emit React state changes to Phaser
  const handleGameAction = useCallback((action: string) => {
    phaserGameRef.current?.events.emit('ui-action', action);
  }, []);
};
```

### Error Handling Edge Cases

```typescript
// Voice recognition error recovery
interface VoiceErrorHandler {
  handleMicrophoneError(): void {
    this.showErrorMessage("Microphone access denied. Using keyboard controls.");
    this.enableKeyboardFallback();
  }
  
  handleONNXLoadFailure(): void {
    console.warn("ONNX models failed to load, falling back to Web Speech API");
    this.initializeWebSpeechAPI();
  }
  
  handleUnrecognizedCommand(audio: string): void {
    this.displayFeedback(`Heard: "${audio}" - Try: JUMP, RUN, CLIMB, DASH, FLIP`);
    this.resetListeningState();
  }
}
```
