# CTC Implementation - Separated Workflow

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented and **separated** CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) for phoneme sequence recognition as requested in Epic 1: Live Phoneme CTCs. The implementation is now in its own `workflows/ctc_w2v2_workflow/` directory, completely separate from the MLP workflow.

## 🚀 Usage - Two Separate Workflows

### 1. MLP Workflow (Original)

```bash
cd workflows/mlp_control_workflow
python 0_workflow.py
# Test: python validations/classify_voice_pkl.py
```

### 2. CTC Workflow (New)

```bash
cd workflows/ctc_w2v2_workflow
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ctc_workflow.py
# Test: python validations/classify_voice_ctc.py
```

## 🔄 Workflow Separation Benefits

### Clean Architecture

- **No mixing**: MLP and CTC workflows are completely separate
- **Independent dependencies**: Each has its own requirements.txt
- **Clear purpose**: Each directory has a single, focused responsibility
- **Easy switching**: Use MLP for single phonemes, CTC for sequences

### Development Advantages

- **Parallel development**: Teams can work on MLP and CTC independently
- **Dependency isolation**: PyTorch only needed for CTC workflow
- **Testing isolation**: Test each approach separately
- **Deployment choices**: Deploy MLP, CTC, or both as needed

## 📊 Workflow Comparison

| Feature | MLP Workflow | CTC Workflow |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **Location** | `workflows/mlp_control_workflow/` | `workflows/ctc_w2v2_workflow/` |
| **Purpose** | Single phoneme classification | Phoneme sequence recognition |
| **Dependencies** | sklearn, numpy, transformers | PyTorch, transformers, soundfile |
| **Training** | Fast sklearn MLP | PyTorch LSTM + CTC |
| **Input** | Mean-pooled embeddings | Temporal sequences |
| **Output** | Single phoneme | Variable-length sequences |
| **Real-time** | ✅ Fast inference | ✅ Sequence inference |
| **Memory** | Low | Higher (temporal data) |

## 🎛️ How to Choose

### Use MLP Workflow When

- Single phoneme classification is sufficient
- Fast inference is critical
- Limited compute resources
- Simple deployment requirements
- Existing sklearn infrastructure

### Use CTC Workflow When

- Need phoneme sequence recognition
- Want alignment-free training
- Have temporal speech data
- PyTorch infrastructure available
- Advanced sequence modeling needed

## 🔧 Quick Start

### MLP (Single Phonemes)

```bash
cd workflows/mlp_control_workflow
python 0_workflow.py                    # Train MLP
python validations/classify_voice_pkl.py  # Test
```

### CTC (Phoneme Sequences)

```bash
cd workflows/ctc_w2v2_workflow
pip install -r requirements.txt        # Install PyTorch deps
python ctc_workflow.py                  # Train CTC
python validations/classify_voice_ctc.py # Test
```

## 🧪 Testing Both Approaches

### Compare Performance

```bash
# Test MLP
cd workflows/mlp_control_workflow
python validations/classify_voice_pkl.py

# Test CTC  
cd ../ctc_w2v2_workflow
python validations/classify_voice_ctc.py
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# MLP tests (if available)
cd workflows/mlp_control_workflow
python -m pytest

# CTC tests
cd ../ctc_w2v2_workflow  
python test_ctc_model.py
```

## 📋 Dependencies

### MLP Workflow Dependencies

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy transformers soundfile
```

### CTC Workflow Dependencies

```bash
cd workflows/ctc_w2v2_workflow
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Includes: torch, transformers, soundfile, numpy, pandas
```

## 🎭 Graceful Fallbacks

Both workflows include graceful fallbacks:

- **Missing dependencies**: Clear error messages with install instructions
- **Mock modes**: Test functionality without full dependencies
- **Error handling**: Robust error handling and logging

## 🔮 Next Steps

1. **Choose approach**: Decide between MLP, CTC, or both based on requirements
2. **Install dependencies**: Set up appropriate Python environments
3. **Train models**: Run workflows with your phoneme data
4. **Evaluate performance**: Compare accuracy, speed, memory usage
5. **Deploy**: Use ONNX export for production deployment

## ✅ Implementation Status

✅ **Complete separation**: MLP and CTC workflows are independent  
✅ **CTC architecture**: Full PyTorch LSTM + CTC implementation  
✅ **Training pipelines**: Both workflows have complete training  
✅ **Inference systems**: Real-time testing for both approaches  
✅ **Documentation**: README and usage instructions for both  
✅ **Dependency management**: Separate requirements and fallbacks  
✅ **Testing**: Comprehensive test suites for validation
