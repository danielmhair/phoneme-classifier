# üéØ Next Steps Guide: Moving Forward with Phoneme Classifier Project

**Current Status**: Epic 1 (Live Phoneme CTCs) - INCOMPLETE - Critical blockers prevent completion  
**Theme**: Automatic Phoneme Recognition (APR) for children's speech  
**Focus**: Fix remaining issues and advance to next epic

---

## üìä **Where You Are Right Now**

### üö® **Epic 1: Live Phoneme CTCs - NOT COMPLETE**

**TRUTH**: Epic 1 is incomplete despite sophisticated architecture because:

- **No ONNX export to games achieved** - Epic completion criteria not met
- **Training pipeline broken** with dummy data instead of real audio
- **Cannot validate CTC functionality** due to implementation gaps
- **Architecture exists but is non-functional** for actual phoneme recognition

### üö® **Critical Blockers (Must Fix First)**

**Priority 1**: Training script uses dummy data instead of real audio
**Priority 2**: Missing Python dependencies in environment  
**Priority 3**: Architecture disconnect between model and training

---

## üöÄ **Immediate Action Plan (Next 1-2 Days)**

### **Step 1: Fix Environment Setup**

```bash
# Test current Python environment
poe debug-ctc

# If issues, repair environment
python -m venv .venv --upgrade-deps
source .venv/bin/activate
poe setup-cuda

# Verify dependencies
poe workflows
```

### **Step 2: Fix Critical Training Bug**

**Issue**: `workflows/ctc_w2v2_workflow/s3_ctc_classifier.py:152, 189`

```python
# CURRENT (BROKEN):
input_values=embeddings.mean(dim=2),  # Dummy audio input

# FIX TO:  
input_values=actual_audio_tensor,     # Real audio input
```

### **Step 3: Test End-to-End Workflow**

```bash
# Test CTC workflow
cd workflows/ctc_w2v2_workflow
python 0_workflow.py

# Test inference
python validations/classify_voice_ctc.py

# Verify both workflows work
poe test-all
```

## üìà **Short-term Goals (Next Week)**

### **Complete Epic 1 (Architecture exists ‚Üí Functional system with ONNX export)**

1. **Performance Validation**
   - Compare CTC vs MLP accuracy on your phoneme data
   - Document which approach works better for different scenarios
   - Benchmark memory usage and training time

2. **Production Features**
   - Implement beam search decoding (currently placeholder)
   - Add ONNX export for CTC models
   - Test deployment compatibility

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Run full test suite: `poe test-all`
   - Validate both workflows independently
   - Document usage patterns and best practices

## üéØ **Strategic Direction: Next Epic Selection**

Based on your current state, here are the **best next epics** to tackle:

### **Recommended: Epic 2 - Live Streaming Improvements (Temporal Brain)**

**Why This Makes Sense**:
- Builds directly on CTC temporal modeling work
- Leverages your sophisticated sequence handling
- Natural progression from static to streaming recognition
- High impact for real-time applications

**Key Activities**:
- Real-time audio streaming integration
- Temporal context maintenance across audio chunks
- Low-latency inference optimization
- Buffer management for continuous recognition

### **Alternative: Epic 4 - Multi-Model Bake-off Harness**

**Why This Could Work**:
- Perfect timing with both MLP and CTC complete
- Systematic comparison framework
- Foundation for future model additions
- Quality-focused approach aligns with your testing emphasis

**Key Activities**:
- Automated benchmarking framework
- Performance comparison dashboards  
- Model evaluation metrics standardization
- A/B testing infrastructure

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Priorities by Epic Choice**

### **If Epic 2 (Streaming) - Technical Focus**

```bash
# Streaming-focused development
poe improve --performance --real-time
poe design --streaming-architecture  
poe implement --buffer-management
```

**Key Technologies**: WebRTC, streaming buffers, chunk processing

### **If Epic 4 (Bake-off) - Infrastructure Focus**  

```bash
# Benchmarking-focused development
poe design --evaluation-framework
poe implement --automated-testing
poe analyze --model-comparison
```

**Key Technologies**: MLflow, benchmarking frameworks, automated evaluation

---

## üìã **Daily Workflow Recommendations**

### **Development Cycle**

```bash
# Morning routine
poe info                    # Check project status
poe debug-ctc              # Verify CTC environment
poe train-ctc              # Test training pipeline

# Development work
poe format && poe lint     # Maintain code quality
poe test-all              # Validate changes

# End of day
poe full-pipeline         # Complete validation
```

### **Progress Tracking**

Track your work using the established patterns:
- **Notion Epics**: Update epic status and task completion
- **Documentation**: Keep docs/ folder current with progress
- **Testing**: Maintain comprehensive test coverage

---

## üö® **Watch Out For These Issues**

### **Common Pitfalls**

1. **Environment Issues**: Missing dependencies break workflows
2. **Data Compatibility**: Existing recordings may need preprocessing  
3. **Memory Usage**: CTC models use more memory than MLP
4. **Performance Expectations**: CTC may not always outperform MLP

### **Quality Gates**

Before moving to next epic, ensure:
- [ ] Both workflows run without errors
- [ ] Performance comparison complete
- [ ] ONNX export working
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Tests passing: `poe test-all`

---

## üéÆ **Game Plan Summary**

### **This Week**: Complete Epic 1
1. Fix environment and training bugs (Day 1-2)
2. Validate performance and add missing features (Day 3-4)  
3. Polish documentation and deployment (Day 5)

### **Next Week**: Start Next Epic
1. Choose between Epic 2 (Streaming) or Epic 4 (Bake-off)
2. Design architecture and plan implementation
3. Begin development with established patterns

### **Following Weeks**: Epic Execution
1. Implement core features with quality focus
2. Maintain testing and documentation standards
3. Prepare for subsequent epic transitions

## üìû **When You're Ready to Move Forward**

### **Epic 1 Completion Checklist**
- [ ] `poe test-all` passes
- [ ] CTC vs MLP comparison documented
- [ ] ONNX export working
- [ ] Both workflows independently functional
- [ ] Performance benchmarks complete

### **Next Epic Kickoff**
- [ ] Epic choice made (Epic 2 or Epic 4 recommended)
- [ ] Architecture designed
- [ ] Development environment ready
- [ ] Success criteria defined

---

## üéØ **Bottom Line**

**Epic 1 is NOT complete** - despite sophisticated architecture, critical implementation gaps prevent functional phoneme recognition and ONNX export to games. 

**Epic 2 (Streaming)** is the natural next step to leverage your CTC temporal modeling work for real-time applications.

**Your code quality is exceptional** - maintain this standard as you progress through the remaining epics.

**Estimated timeline**: Significant work required to fix training pipeline, achieve ONNX export, and actually complete Epic 1 before moving to next epic.
