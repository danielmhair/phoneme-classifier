## üöÄ **Immediate Action Plan (Next 1-2 Days)**

### **Step 1: Monitor CTC Workflow Progress üîÑ IN PROGRESS**

```bash
# Monitor the current CTC workflow
tail -f logs/ctc_workflow_log_20250822_195942.txt

# Check process status  
ps aux | grep "python workflows/ctc_w2v2_workflow"

# Check generated files periodically
ls -la dist/
```

### **Step 2: CTC Workflow Timeline**

**Current Workflow**: CTC Wav2Vec2 (Started 19:59 PM, Aug 22)
- **Current Phase**: Audio dataset preparation with augmentation (Step 2/5)
- **Progress**: Processing phoneme directories for temporal sequence modeling
- **Estimated completion**: 4-6 hours (by 23:59 PM - 01:59 AM Aug 23)
- **Next phases**: Temporal embedding extraction ‚Üí CTC training ‚Üí Inference testing
- **Resource usage**: High CPU/memory expected during Wav2Vec2 feature extraction

### **Step 3: Post-CTC Training Validation**

```bash
# After CTC workflow completes, verify CTC models
ls -la dist/ctc_model_best.pt dist/ctc_label_encoder.pkl dist/*.json

# Test CTC trained models
cd workflows/ctc_w2v2_workflow
python validations/classify_voice_ctc.py

# Compare with MLP results
cd ../mlp_control_workflow  
python validations/classify_voice_pkl.py
```

## üìà **Short-term Goals (Next Week)**

### **Complete Epic 1 (Architecture exists ‚Üí Functional system with ONNX export)**

1. **Performance Validation**
   - Compare CTC vs MLP accuracy on your phoneme data
   - Document which approach works better for different scenarios
   - Benchmark memory usage and training time

2. **Production Features**
   - Implement beam search decoding (currently placeholder)
   - Add ONNX export for CTC models
   - Test deployment compatibility

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Run full test suite: `poe test-all`
   - Validate both workflows independently
   - Document usage patterns and best practices

## üéØ **Strategic Direction: Next Epic Selection**

Based on your current state, here are the **best next epics** to tackle:

### **Recommended: Epic 2 - Live Streaming Improvements (Temporal Brain)**

**Why This Makes Sense**:
- Builds directly on CTC temporal modeling work
- Leverages your sophisticated sequence handling
- Natural progression from static to streaming recognition
- High impact for real-time applications

**Key Activities**:
- Real-time audio streaming integration
- Temporal context maintenance across audio chunks
- Low-latency inference optimization
- Buffer management for continuous recognition

### **Alternative: Epic 4 - Multi-Model Bake-off Harness**

**Why This Could Work**:
- Perfect timing with both MLP and CTC complete
- Systematic comparison framework
- Foundation for future model additions
- Quality-focused approach aligns with your testing emphasis

**Key Activities**:
- Automated benchmarking framework
- Performance comparison dashboards  
- Model evaluation metrics standardization
- A/B testing infrastructure

poe info                    # Check project status
poe debug-ctc              # Verify CTC environment
poe train-ctc              # Test training pipeline

# Development work
poe format && poe lint     # Maintain code quality
poe test-all              # Validate changes

# End of day
poe full-pipeline         # Complete validation
```

### **Progress Tracking**

Track your work using the established patterns:
- **Notion Epics**: Update epic status and task completion
- **Documentation**: Keep docs/ folder current with progress
- **Testing**: Maintain comprehensive test coverage

## üö® **Watch Out For These Issues**

### **Common Pitfalls**

1. **Environment Issues**: Missing dependencies break workflows
2. **Data Compatibility**: Existing recordings may need preprocessing

Before moving to next epic, ensure:
- [ ] Both workflows run without errors
- [ ] Performance comparison complete
- [ ] ONNX export working
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Tests passing: `poe test-all`
