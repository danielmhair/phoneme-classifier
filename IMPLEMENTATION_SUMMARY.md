# Epic 1: Live Phoneme CTCs - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Mission Accomplished

Successfully implemented **CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification)** for phoneme sequence recognition with complete workflow separation as requested.

## üìã What Was Delivered

### ‚úÖ Complete CTC Implementation

- **CTC Model Architecture**: PyTorch LSTM + Wav2Vec2 + CTC Loss
- **Temporal Processing**: Preserves sequence information (vs MLP mean pooling)
- **Training Pipeline**: Full PyTorch training with validation and checkpointing
- **Real-time Inference**: Interactive CLI for live testing
- **Beam Search Decoding**: Advanced inference with configurable beam width

### ‚úÖ Clean Workflow Separation

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ctc_w2v2_workflow/       # CTC workflow
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/                  # Shared workflow utilities
```

### ‚úÖ Two Independent Systems

| **MLP Workflow** | **CTC Workflow** |
|------------------|------------------|
| Single phoneme classification | Phoneme sequence recognition |
| Fast sklearn training | Advanced PyTorch training |
| Mean-pooled features | Temporal sequence features |
| `python 0_workflow.py` | `python 0_workflow.py` |
| Low memory usage | Higher memory (sequences) |
| Simple deployment | Advanced sequence modeling |

## üöÄ How to Use

### Option 1: MLP (Single Phonemes)

```bash
cd workflows/mlp_control_workflow
python 0_workflow.py
python validations/classify_voice_pkl.py
```

### Option 2: CTC (Phoneme Sequences)

```bash
cd workflows/ctc_w2v2_workflow
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ctc_workflow.py
python validations/classify_voice_ctc.py
```

### Option 3: Both (Compare Performance)

Run both workflows and compare results for your specific use case.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Benefits

### Separation Advantages

- **No conflicts**: Each workflow is completely independent
- **Focused purpose**: MLP for speed, CTC for sequences
- **Easy switching**: Choose the right tool for each task
- **Parallel development**: Teams can work on each approach separately
- **Clean dependencies**: PyTorch only needed for CTC

### Technical Improvements

- **Alignment-free training**: CTC handles variable-length sequences automatically
- **Temporal modeling**: LSTM captures speech dynamics over time
- **Sequence outputs**: Can predict multiple phonemes in order
- **Real-time capable**: Both approaches support live inference

## üéØ Epic 1 Success Criteria Met

‚úÖ **Live Phoneme Recognition**: Both real-time MLP and CTC inference  
‚úÖ **CTC Implementation**: Complete temporal sequence modeling  
‚úÖ **Alignment-free**: No manual phoneme-audio alignment required  
‚úÖ **Variable Sequences**: Handles different length phoneme sequences  
‚úÖ **Production Ready**: ONNX export capability for deployment  
‚úÖ **Clean Architecture**: Separated workflows for maintainability  

## üî¨ Testing & Validation

### Quick Tests

```bash
# Test CTC structure
cd workflows/ctc_w2v2_workflow && python test_ctc_model.py

# Test both workflows exist
cd .. && ls -la */0_workflow.py */ctc_workflow.py
```

### Performance Comparison

Run both workflows with the same data to compare:

- **Accuracy**: Single phoneme vs sequence recognition
- **Speed**: sklearn MLP vs PyTorch CTC
- **Memory**: Mean-pooled vs temporal sequences
- **Use cases**: When to use each approach

## üéâ Result

**Two complete, independent phoneme recognition systems:**

1. **MLP Workflow** - Fast, simple, single phoneme classification
2. **CTC Workflow** - Advanced, sequence-aware, temporal modeling

Both ready for production use with your phoneme data!
